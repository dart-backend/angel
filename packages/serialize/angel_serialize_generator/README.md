The builder for Angel3 serialization.

## Usage

1. Create a model class in `todo.dart` and annotate it with `@serializable`

    ```dart
        import 'package:angel3_serialize/angel3_serialize.dart';
        part 'todo.g.dart';

        @serializable
        class _Todo {
            String? text;
            bool? completed;
        }
    ```

2. Run the following command to generate the associated `todo.g.dart` file for serialization.

    ```bash
        dart run build_runner build
    ```
