<https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/249>

## 2.0.5-beta

* Make `@Expose()` in `Controller` optional. <https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/issues/107>
* Add `allowHttp1` to `AngelHttp2` constructors. <https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/issues/108>

* Add `HostnameRouter`, which allows for routing based on hostname. <https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/issues/110>
* Default to using `ThrowingReflector`, instead of `EmptyReflector`. This will give a more descriptive
error when trying to use controllers, etc. without reflection enabled.
* `mountController` returns the mounted controller.

## 2.0.4+1

* Make `Controller.configureServer` always return a `Future`.

* Accept any content type if accept header is missing. See
[this PR](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/pull/239).

## 2.0.3

* Patch up a bug caused by an upstream change to Dart's stream semantics.
See more: <https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/issues/106#issuecomment-499564485>

## 2.0.2

* Make `ResponseContext` *explicitly* implement `StreamConsumer` (though technically it already did???)
* Split `Controller.configureServer` to create `Controller.applyRoutes`.

## 2.0.1

* Tracked down a bug in `Driver.runPipeline` that allowed fallback
handlers to run, even after the response was closed.
* Add `RequestContext.shutdownHooks`.
* Call `RequestContext.close` in `Driver.sendResponse`.
* AngelConfigurer is now `FutureOr<void>`, instead of just `FutureOr`.
* Use a `Container.has<Stopwatch>` check in `Driver.sendResponse`.
* Remove unnecessary `new` and `const`.

* Add `AngelEnvironment` class.
  * Add `Angel.environment`.
  * Deprecated `app.isProduction` in favor of `app.environment.isProduction`.

## 2.0.0-alpha.23

* `ResponseContext.render` sets `charset` to `utf8` in `contentType`.

## 2.0.0-alpha.22

## 2.0.0-alpha.20

## 2.0.0-alpha.9

* Add `Service.map`.

## 2.0.0-alpha.8

* No longer export HTTP-specific code from `angel_framework.dart`.
  An import of `import 'package:angel_framework/http.dart';` will be necessary in most cases now.

## 2.0.0-alpha.7

* Force a tigher contract on services. They now must return `Data` on all
  methods except for `index`, which returns a `List<Data>`.

## 2.0.0-alpha.6

* Allow passing a custom `Container` to `handleContained` and co.

## 2.0.0-alpha.5

* `MapService` methods now explicitly return `Map<String, dynamic>`.

## 2.0.0-alpha.4

* Renamed `waterfall` to `chain`.
* Renamed `Routable.service` to `Routable.findService`.
  * Also `Routable.findHookedService`.

## 2.0.0-alpha.3

* Added `<Id, Data>` type parameters to `Service`.
* `HookedService` now follows suit, and takes a third parameter, pointing to the inner service.
* `Routable.use` now uses the generic parameters added to `Service`.
* Added generic usage to `HookedServiceListener`, etc.
* All service methods take `Map<String, dynamic>` as `params` now.

## 2.0.0-alpha.2

* Added `ResponseContext.detach`.

## 2.0.0-alpha.1

* Removed `Angel.injectEncoders`.
* Added `Providers.toJson`.
* Moved `Providers.graphql` to `Providers.graphQL`.
* `Angel.optimizeForProduction` no longer calls `preInject`,
  as it does not need to.
* Rename `ResponseContext.enableBuffer` to `ResponseContext.useBuffer`.

## 2.0.0-alpha

* Removed `random_string` dependency.
* Moved reflection to `package:angel_container`.
* Upgraded `package:file` to `5.0.0`.
* `ResponseContext.sendFile` now uses `package:file`.
* Abandon `ContentType` in favor of `MediaType`.
* Changed view engine to use `Map<String, dynamic>`.
* Remove dependency on `package:json_god` by default.
* Remove dependency on `package:dart2_constant`.
* Moved `lib/hooks.dart` into `package:angel_hooks`.
* Moved `TypedService` into `package:angel_typed_service`.
* Completely removed the `AngelBase` class.
* Removed all `@deprecated` symbols.
* `Service.toId` was renamed to `Service.parseId`; it also now uses its
  single type argument to determine how to parse a value. \* In addition, this method was also made `static`.
* `RequestContext` and `ResponseContext` are now generic, and take a
  single type argument pointing to the underlying request/response type,
  respectively.
* `RequestContext.io` and `ResponseContext.io` are now permanently
  gone.
* `HttpRequestContextImpl` and `HttpResponseContextImpl` were renamed to
  `HttpRequestContext` and `HttpResponseContext`.
* Lazy-parsing request bodies is now the default; `Angel.lazyParseBodies` was replaced
  with `Angel.eagerParseRequestBodies`.
* `Angel.storeOriginalBuffer` -> `Angel.storeRawRequestBuffers`.
* The methods `lazyBody`, `lazyFiles`, and `lazyOriginalBuffer` on `ResponseContext` were all
  replaced with `parseBody`, `parseUploadedFiles`, and `parseRawRequestBuffer`, respectively.
* Removed the synchronous equivalents of the above methods (`body`, `files`, and `originalBuffer`),
  as well as `query`.
* Removed `Angel.injections` and `RequestContext.injections`.
* Removed `Angel.inject` and `RequestContext.inject`.
* Removed a dependency on `package:pool`, which also meant removing `AngelHttp.throttle`.
* Remove the `RequestMiddleware` typedef; from now on, one should use `ResponseContext.end`
  exclusively to close responses.
* `waterfall` will now only accept `RequestHandler`.
* `Routable`, and all of its subclasses, now extend `Router<RequestHandler>`, and therefore only
  take routes in the form of `FutureOr myFunc(RequestContext, ResponseContext res)`.
* `@Middleware` now takes an `Iterable` of `RequestHandler`s.
* `@Expose.path` now *must* be a `String`, not just any `Pattern`.
* `@Expose.middleware` now takes `Iterable<RequestHandler>`, instead of just `List`.
* `createDynamicHandler` was renamed to `ioc`, and is now used to run IoC-aware handlers in a
  type-safe manner.
* `RequestContext.params` is now a `Map<String, dynamic>`, rather than just a `Map`.
* Removed `RequestContext.grab`.
* Removed `RequestContext.properties`.
* Removed the defunct `debug` property where it still existed.
* `Routable.use` now only accepts a `Service`.
* Removed `Angel.createZoneForRequest`.
* Removed `Angel.defaultZoneCreator`.
* Added all flags to the `Angel` constructor, ex. `Angel.eagerParseBodies`.
* Fix a bug where synchronous errors in `handleRequest` would not be caught.
* `AngelHttp.useZone` now defaults to `false`.
* `ResponseContext` now starts in streaming mode by default; the response buffer is opt-in,
  as in many cases it is unnecessary and slows down response time.
* `ResponseContext.streaming` was replaced by `ResponseContext.isBuffered`.
* Made `LockableBytesBuilder` public.
* Removed the now-obsolete `ResponseContext.willCloseItself`.
* Removed `ResponseContext.dispose`.
* Removed the now-obsolete `ResponseContext.end`.
* Removed the now-obsolete `ResponseContext.releaseCorrespondingRequest`.
* `preInject` now takes a `Reflector` as its second argument.
* `Angel.reflector` defaults to `const EmptyReflector()`, disabling
  reflection out-of-the-box.
